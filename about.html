<p>Everyone thinks they know the story about how the Backstreet Boys got formed.

Except, speaking as a die hard fan, I know that many people don’t. A tweet from Nick had a lot of surprised replies at the fact there was a promotional photo of five Backstreet Boys, but two of which were not Kevin or Brian. It was before they joined the group. The amount of shocked fans made me realize that Holy Howie, not everyone knows the real story. The Boys have talked about pieces of it at certain points, most recently being their Grammy Museum Q&A. I know I reference that interview a lot but it’s because it really is informative (and funny). Denise also talks about it in the book she published years ago. As does the “official biography” that was put out in 1997. There’s an interview or two that touches upon it as well.

All of this along with whatever videos I can find online or from our media archive will be used to put it together for you guys. Because the Backstreet Boys just aren’t quite right without Kevin and Brian, but it did take a minute to get there.

It’s hard to imagine, isn’t it? A Backstreet Boys group without Kevin’s smooth way of doing things. No Brian jumping around on stage, or saying Gotta Go!. The group we know today is only complete when we have Kevin, Nick, AJ, Brian and Howie. (Though I do have a post coming soon to address the Kevin-less time). At one point and time however, this was absolutely a reality. The Kentucky cousins were later found and well, destiny seemed to have a hand in it. But let’s go back, all the way to the beginning.</p>
<p>Backstreet Boys (often abbreviated as BSB) is an American vocal group, formed in Orlando, Florida in 1993. The group consists of AJ McLean, Howie Dorough, Nick Carter, Kevin Richardson, and Brian Littrell.

    The group rose to fame with their debut international album, Backstreet Boys (1996). In the following year, they released their second international album Backstreet's Back (1997) along with their self-titled U.S. debut album, which continued the group's success worldwide. They rose to superstardom with their third studio album Millennium (1999) and its follow-up album, Black & Blue (2000). After a two-year hiatus, they regrouped and released a comeback album Never Gone (2005). After the conclusion of the Never Gone Tour in 2006, Richardson left the group to pursue other interests. The group then released two albums as a quartet: Unbreakable (2007) and This Is Us (2009).
    
    In 2012, the group announced that Richardson had rejoined them permanently. In the following year, they celebrated their 20th anniversary and released their first independent album, In a World Like This (2013). Their 2019 album DNA debuted at number one, more than two decades after the group formed, and 19 years after they last topped in 2000. They also became the first boy band to top the U.S. album charts in three different decades.
    
    The Backstreet Boys have sold over 100 million records worldwide, making them the best-selling boy band of all time, and one of the world's best-selling music artists. They are the first group since Led Zeppelin to have their first ten albums reach the top 10 on the Billboard 200, and the only boy band to do so. The group received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on April 22, 2013. The group also released their first documentary movie, titled Backstreet Boys: Show 'Em What You're Made Of in January 2015.</p>
